The `rust` implementation is under [jcs090218/flx-rs](https://github.com/jcs090218/flx-rs)
; hence this repo will only contain releases to ELPA and ready-to-use binary files.

## ðŸ”¨ Usage

Load by calling the following function,

```el
(flx-rs-load-dyn)
```

Calculate the score with `PATTERN` and `SOURCE`:

```el
(flx-rs-score "something" "some else thing")
```

## ðŸ’¥ Replace `flx`

To completely replace `flx` with this package, add the following line to your
configuration.

```el
(advice-add 'flx-score :override #'flx-rs-score)
```
